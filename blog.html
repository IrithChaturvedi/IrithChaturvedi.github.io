            <h3>Vietnam</h3>
            <img src="assets/blog/vietnam.png" alt="Vietnam">

            <p>
                This Southeast Asian gem has gained prominence among world travelers in the past few years. 
                Within its communist beginnings and colonial history lies a nation epitomizing Asia as a whole. 
                Whether it's the capitals or the rainforests, the longest caves in the world, or the tourist-trodden bays, 
                Vietnam is a budget-friendly and exciting destination to discover—whether you live right across the border or across the seven seas.
            </p>

            <h4>Planning Your Trip</h4>

            <h5>1) Visa</h5>
            <p>
                The visa process for Vietnam is straightforward, as it offers visa-free entry or e-visa access to most nationalities. 
                Be cautious of third-party websites charging high fees; apply directly through the official Vietnamese government website: 
                <a href="https://vietnamvisa.govt.vn/apply-online" target="_blank">Apply for a Vietnam e-Visa</a>. The cost is around USD 25 per person.
            </p>

            <h5>2) Duration</h5>
            <p>
                The ideal length of stay depends on your budget, vacation days, and itinerary. 
                A recommended duration is 15 days, allowing ample time to explore the country from north to south, 
                beginning in one capital and ending in the other. Vietnam can be visited year-round, though summer months are hot and humid—perfect for enjoying Ha Long Bay.
            </p>

            <h5>3) Packing</h5>
            <p>
                Pack light for a warm and humid climate. Fun fact: many of your clothes are probably made in Vietnam! 
                Instead of overpacking, consider buying high-quality, affordable clothing locally.
            </p>

            <h5>4) Flights</h5>
            <p>
                If you want to travel cheap, fly Viet Jet, it is as simple as that. They are the Wizz Air, the Frontier 
                Airlines and the Spirit airlines of the East. Important: check the deals on their own website and nowhere 
                else, some of the deals that they provide will make you rub your eyes in disbelief. However, if you do 
                find comfort to be the most imnportant trait of your journey, Vietnam Airlines, Bamboo Airlines and Thai 
                Airways provide great options with impeccable service.

            <h5><strong>GEOGRAPHY AND HOT DESTINATIONS</strong></h5>
    
            <p>
                It's best to travel the country lengthwise. Pick your starting point—either <strong>Hanoi</strong> or 
                <strong>Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)</strong>—and end in the other, provided you have at least a fortnight 
                to spare. If time is limited, focus on exploring destinations around either Hanoi or HCMC, as these cities 
                lie at opposite ends of the country.

                As an Indian, I like to call HCMC the <strong>"Bombay of Vietnam"</strong>—and rightly 
                so. It's the country's bustling business hub, filled with skyscrapers, yet deeply rooted in 
                history. The city played a pivotal role in Vietnam's independence from the French and its 
                later liberation in the 1970s. Named after <strong>Ho Chi Minh</strong>, it's famous for the 
                <strong>Cu Chi Tunnels</strong>, showcasing the brutal guerrilla warfare tactics used 
                against the Americans.

                <strong>a) Cu Chi Tunnel</strong><br>
                A 45-minute drive from the heart of HCMC lies a remnant of the Vietnam War in its rawest form. 
                The Cu Chi Tunnels showcase a network of tunnels used by pro-Communist Vietnamese forces to survive 
                the war and fight back against the Americans, employing tactics of deception and leveraging 
                their greatest ally—Mother Nature.
