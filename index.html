            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                I am <strong>Irith Chaturvedi</strong>, a Senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in 
                <strong>Data Science + Information Science</strong> with minors in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Statistics</strong>. 
                With a 4.0 GPA, I am a <em>James Scholar</em> and <em>Dean’s List recipient</em> every semester.
            </p>

            <p>
                My professional experiences span <strong>research, industry, hackathons, and non-profit work</strong>, allowing me to apply 
                data-driven techniques across diverse domains while leading impactful projects.
            </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                As an <em>Undergraduate Researcher</em> in the <strong>Biodiversity Genomics Lab</strong> under Dr. Milton Tan, I contributed 
                to a groundbreaking phylogenetic analysis of Cypriniformes. I addressed challenges of polyploidy and hybridization using 
                targeted assembly and <strong>workflow automation with Nextflow</strong>. By developing a novel weighted scoring algorithm 
                and leveraging <strong>Python parallelization and R statistical analysis</strong>, I reduced runtime by 60% and improved 
                alignment accuracy by 94%.
            </p>

            <h3>Industry</h3>
            <p>
                At <strong>COUNTRY Financial DigitaLab</strong>, I served as a Data Science and Project Management Intern within the 
                <em>Sales Compensation Agile Release Train</em>. I built automated pipelines in <strong>PySpark, Hive, and Python</strong>, 
                saving 140+ hours of manual QA per month. I also enhanced CI/CD pipelines with automated test frameworks and led a 
                4-member intern team to design an <strong>Agentic AI assistant</strong> that converts legacy HQL scripts into PySpark with 
                automated PyTest generation.
            </p>

            <h3>Hackathon</h3>
            <p>
                I led my team to <strong>1st place</strong> at the <em>COUNTRY Financial Hackathon 2025</em>, creating 
                <strong>GitMyWiki</strong>—an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates 
                <strong>Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, and Streamlit</strong> to retrieve and summarize internal documentation. 
                The solution is being pushed into production at COUNTRY.
            </p>

            <h3>Non-Profit</h3>
            <p>
                As an <em>IT Intern</em> at the <strong>21st Century Dads Foundation</strong>, I developed a mobile app (1,000+ users), 
                managed AWS and SQL databases, and performed grant research that secured $120,000 in funding. I also helped raise $80,000+ 
                through fundraising events such as the <em>Dads Honor Ride</em>, supporting families of children with special needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Leadership & Global Engagement</h3>
            <p>
                I serve as Head of Scholarship, Philanthropy, and Recruitment at <strong>Theta Xi Fraternity</strong>, where I organized 
                a professional <em>Speaker Series</em> and implemented academic initiatives that raised the chapter GPA from 2.8 to 3.3. 
                Beyond campus, I have traveled to <strong>40+ countries</strong>, volunteered globally with <strong>Habitat for Humanity</strong>, 
                and continue to pursue leadership through service and collaboration.
            </p>

            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I am actively seeking internships and opportunities in <strong>Data Science, Consulting, Data Engineering, and Management</strong>, 
                where I can combine my technical expertise, research background, and leadership experience to drive innovation and impact.
