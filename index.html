            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I am Irith Chaturvedi, a rising junior in the Data Science and Statistics program at the University of Illinois. As an international student from New Delhi, India, I have developed an adaptability and curiosity that drive me to explore global opportunities.</p>

            <p>My experiences span both technical and leadership domains. As an undergraduate Research Assistant at the university's Biodiversity Genomics Lab, I worked under Dr. Milton Tan to reconstruct the Tree of Life for fish phylogenies, applying data-driven techniques to complex biological datasets, handling novel issues of gene duplication and hybridization using a normalized reference scoring method developed by me.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I have undertaken independent projects analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on U.S. pharmaceutical stock prices by integrating and cleaning datasets from the Alpha Vantage API and Johns Hopkins University, leveraging Python, SQL, and OpenRefine for data processing, and automating workflows using Snakemake. I also designed a machine learning model to identify affordable housing options in U.S. Northeast, integrating spatial visualizations and predictive analytics to recommend neighborhoods and properties based on family size, budget, and proximity to schools.</p>

            <p>My technical projects include computer vision work with PyTorch, creating an image recognition program using CNNs that achieves 98.5% accuracy in deciphering alphabets, numbers, and objects. I also serve as a Course Assistant for the STAT 420 course on Regression Modeling and Applications under Dr. Julie Deeke at the University of Illinois Department of Statistics.</p>

            <p>Beyond academics, I interned at the 21st Century Dads Foundation in Chicago, where I managed a database of over a thousand families worldwide, optimized engagement through data visualization, and contributed to mobile app development. As Social Media Lead for the Dads Honor Ride fundraiser, I blended data-driven decision-making with strategic outreach to help raise $80,000, and secured $120,000 in marketing funds through grant writing.</p>

            <p>This portfolio showcases my professional journey through my resume, projects, academic transcript, and personal interests. Explore the links above to learn more about my qualifications and experiences.</p>
