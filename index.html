            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I am Irith Chaturvedi, a junior in the Data Science and Statistics program at the University of Illinois.
                As an international student from New Delhi, India, I have developed an adaptability and curiosity
                that drive me to explore global opportunities.

                My experiences span both technical and leadership domains. As an undergraduate Research
                Assistant at the university’s Biodiversity Genomics Lab, I worked under Dr. Milton Tan to reconstruct
                the Tree of Life for fish phylogenies, applying data-driven techniques to complex biological
                datasets, handling novel issues of gene duplication and hybridization using a normalized reference
                scoring method developed by me. Additionally, I have undertaken independent projects analyzing
                the impact of COVID-19 on U.S. pharmaceutical stock prices by integrating and cleaning datasets
                from the Alpha Vantage API and Johns Hopkins University, leveraging Python, SQL, and OpenRefine
                for data processing, and automating workflows using Snakemake. I also designed a machine
                learning model to identify affordable housing options in U.S. Northeast, integrating spatial
                visualizations and predictive analytics to recommend neighborhoods and properties based on
                family size, budget, and proximity to schools and, have projects involving computer vision by
                creating an image recognition program using PyTorch, deciphering alphabets, numbers and objects
                using a CNN with 98.5% accuracy. I am also a part of the Course team at the Department of Statistics
                at the University of Illinois - as a Course Assistant for the STAT 420 course on Regression modeling
                and application with instructor Dr. Julie Deeke.

                Beyond academics, I have interned at the 21st Century Dads Foundation in Chicago, where I
                managed a database of over a thousand families worldwide, optimized engagement through data
                visualization, and helped develop the foundation’s mobile application. My role as Social Media
                Lead for the Dads Honor Ride, a fundraiser supporting families raising children with special needs,
                enabled me to blend data-driven decision-making with strategic outreach, ultimately helping raise
                $80,000. Furthermore, I secured $120,000 in marketing and advertising funds from a single grant
                maker, demonstrating my ability to translate analytical insights into tangible outcomes.

                updated academic transcript and some other interests I have which are not related to my academic
                or professional journey.
