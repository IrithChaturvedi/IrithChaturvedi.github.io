        <h3>Analyzing the Real Estate Market in the US Northeast:</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>The Northeastern region of the USA includes Pennsylvania, Maine, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Despite its historical and cultural significance, affordability remains a challenge for many residents.</p>
            
            <h4>Alternative Places in the U.S. Northeast</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Why Stay in the Northeast?</strong> This project highlights economic stability in the Northeast while identifying affordable alternatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Affordability:</strong> Identifying cities that offer career opportunities without excessive costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Newly Saturated Cities:</strong> Instead of moving to popular Southern cities, this project suggests sister cities with strong career prospects.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Move from New York:</strong> Providing data-driven insights to help individuals relocate to affordable cities without compromising economic growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <h4>Data Retrieval</h4>
            <p>Four datasets were used for analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Per Capita Income per US State (<em>Kaggle</em>)</li>
                <li>Updated House Prices of Northeastern US States (<em>Kaggle</em>)</li>
                <li>Population Statistics of US States (<em>Data.gov</em>)</li>
                <li>Pittsburgh Home Prices Dataset (<em>census.data.gov</em>)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Data Processing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Removed null values, dropped unwanted columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sorting:</strong> Grouped data by state, filtered population data for 2010-2019 trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis & Visualization:</strong> Used <em>Python Pandas</em>, <em>Folium</em>, and <em>Matplotlib</em> to manipulate data and generate insights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Machine Learning Model</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> model to predict the best Pittsburgh neighborhood based on budget, size of house, numer of bedrooms, proximity to school and other features.</li>
                <li>Created a pipeline using <em>StandardScaler()</em> and <em>LogisticRegression()</em> to process and train the data.</li>
                <li>Applied <em>GridSearchCV</em> with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.</li>
                <li>Achieved 95% accuracy in predicting the best US Northeast neighborhood to live in based on your requirements</li>
                <li>Using Zillow's real estate API, ther results of the model and other features are used to report the 10 best properties that suit the users needs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results from Analysis</h3>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted global markets, particularly pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development. This project examines the correlation between U.S. COVID-19 case and death rates and the stock price movements of Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) from 2020 to 2021. The study analyzes market responses to major pandemic events, such as vaccine approvals and peak infection periods.</p>
