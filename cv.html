                    In the field of computational genomics, I have designed, managed, and optimized Targeted Assembly Pipelines for the Cyprinidae and Danionidae family of fish. I am also working on a publication on improving alignment accuracy using statistical analysis in R and a novel weighted scoring method to handle evidence of gene duplication and hybridization.
                </p>
                <div class="project">
                    <h5>Project 1: Reconstructing Evolution and the Tree of Life in Fishes</h5>
                    <p>
                        The aim of the project was to identify genes targeted for sequencing in a previous experiment on the evolution of Cypriniformes. Starting with the creation of a reference set of genomic information for the Zebrafish (Danio Rerio), I identified over 700 unique gene features to be used as reference sequences for targeted assemblies in 41 species of Cyprinids. Coverage and length analysis using Python's data science libraries was conducted to assess sequences suitable for the reference set.

                    <h5>Project 2: Targeted Assembly for Reference Sequences in Cyprinidae using the CAPTUS Pipeline</h5>
                    <p>
                        Using the CAPTUS pipeline developed by Dr. Edgardo Mortiz (initially for plant genomic data), I modified it to conduct targeted assembly for a family of fish (Carps and Minnows). This included using workflow automation software like NEXTflow and functional Python scripts to improve the space and time complexity of the pipeline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used R and its libraries to identify important characteristics and features of Amino acid, Nucleotide, and Clustering alignments to determine useful and unique loci within our results. For analyzing alignment results, IQ-Tree was used to comprehend the genealogy of the family. Parallelization of IQ-Tree processes was done using Python, and the APE (R) package was used for basic unrooted tree visualizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I developed a novel weighted scoring method to match the best references to their respective genomic regions, implemented post the extraction step using computational scripts with multiple data structures, searching, and sorting algorithms.

                <p class="description">
                    As the IT intern for the foundation, I handled database operations with AWS S3 services and MySQL, managing a database of over 2000 foundation members. I identified 15 potential grantmakers using Python's data science libraries based on metrics such as core values, mission, funding targets, and amounts. Through these efforts, I raised $120,000 from a single grantmaker.

                <p class="description">
                    I also developed promotional strategies via social media platforms to attract prospective members and strengthen recruitment efforts. I helped raise $75,000 for the 21st Century Dads Foundation and the Illinois Fatherhood Initiative as part of the “Dads Honor Ride” team at the Race Across America event.
